# Introduction to Statistical Learning Course

Course offered online through [Standford University](https://lagunita.stanford.edu) closely following the text "An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2013). Taught by the text authors.

## [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/JustinMShea/Statistical-Learning/blob/master/R/10-Unsupervised.pdf)

10.1 Principal Components

10.2 k-means Clustering

10.3 Hierarchical Clustering


## [Statement of Accomplishment](https://github.com/JustinMShea/Statistical-Learning/blob/master/ISLR-Statement-of-Accomplishment.pdf)

But of course, what really matters when learning online is not the certificate but how much work and thought one puts in to understanding the material. In this vein, I often referenced _[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)_ to dive deeper into topics of interest. If a topic in ISLR leaves you curious for more, ESLR is an excellent compliment.
